This file calculates the upper and lower triangle matrix achieved using Gauss Elimnation with pivoting.
The required inputs for this program is a singular square matrix.
Given a proper matrix, this algorithm will return the lower triangular matirx of coefficents, upper triangular matrix of solutions, and the pivot matrix that kept track fo the movement of the orginal matrix inputted by the user.
