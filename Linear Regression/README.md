In this algorithm, the user will be able to create a line of best fit by inputting two arrays.
One array is for the dependent variables and one array is for the independent variables.
As a result, this algorithm will output:
1. fX: x-values with outliers removed
2. fY: y-values with outliers removed
3. slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
4. intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
5. Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
