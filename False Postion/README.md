This algorithm requires a user input of an anonymous function, lower x value bound, and upper x value bound to approximate the root of a function.
There is also the option to include a maximum number of iterations and error stopping crieteria, but defalut values are es=0.0001 and maxit=200.
Asuuming everything is inputted correclty, the function will return the root, function used in calculation, the approximate error, and the number of iteration.
