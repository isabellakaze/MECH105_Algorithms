This algorithm was created to practice my MATLAB skills in array manipulation.
Thie inputs of this function are two numbers, the first being the desired number of rows and the second being the desired number of columns.
The resulting matrix of this function will be an array that:
1. Has the value of each element in the first row equal to the number of the corresponding columns
2. Has the value of each element in the first column equal to the number of the corresponding row
